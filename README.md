## Installation
#### 1. ComfyUI-Manager
  1. Search for `ComfyUI-OmniGen` on [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) and install it.
  2. Restart ComfyUI
#### 2. Git Clone
  1. Open the terminal on the ComfyUI `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder
  2. Run `git clone https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-OmniGen.git`
  3. Restart ComfyUI

## Install the required Python packages:
  1. Open the terminal on the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-OmniGen` folder
  2. `..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

<details>
<summary><h3>Auto-Download Feature</h3></summary>

The node includes automatic downloading of:
1. OmniGen code from GitHub repository
2. Model weights from Hugging Face

No manual file downloading is required. The node will handle everything automatically on first use.</details>
>[!IMPORTANT]
>The first time you use this custom node, it will automatically download the model from Hugging Face. Please be patient, as the download size is approximately 15.5 GB, and it may take some time to complete.
>
>Alternatively, you can manually download the model from Hugging Face at the following link:
>Download OmniGen-v1 from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Shitao/OmniGen-v1/tree/main)
>After downloading, place the model in the following directory: `comfyui/models/LLM/OmniGen-v1`

### Example prompts:
  
| Prompt | Image_1 | Image_2 | Image_3 | Output |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 20yo woman looking at viewer |  |  |  | ![wm1](Examples/imgs/wm1.jpg) |
| Transform `image_1` into an oil painting | ![wm1](Examples/imgs/wm1.jpg) |  |  | ![wm1op](Examples/imgs/wm1op.jpg) |
| Transform `image_2` into an Anime | ![m1](Examples/imgs/m1.jpg) |  |  | ![m1a](Examples/imgs/m1a.jpg) |
| The girl in `image_1` sitting on rock on top of the mountain. | ![wm1](Examples/imgs/wm1.jpg) |  |  | ![wm1mt](Examples/imgs/wm1mt.jpg) |
| Combine `image_1` and `image_2` in anime style. | ![wm1](Examples/imgs/wm1.jpg) | ![m1](Examples/imgs/m1.jpg) |  | ![anime](Examples/imgs/anime.jpg) |
| A woman from `image_1` and a man from `image_2` are sitting across from each other at a cozy coffee shop, each holding a cup of coffee and engaging in conversation. | ![wm1](Examples/imgs/wm1.jpg) | ![m1](Examples/imgs/m1.jpg) |  | ![cs](Examples/imgs/cs.jpg) |
| Following the depth mapping of this image `image_1`, generate a new photo: an elderly couple sitting at a cozy coffee shop. The scene should feature the couple enjoying a peaceful moment together at a table. The elderly man, with a gray beard and glasses, and the woman, with short silver hair and a soft cardigan, are sipping coffee and smiling at each other. The atmosphere is warm, with soft, ambient lighting and a blurred background of other patrons, shelves of books, and cafe decorations. The depth and textures from `image_1` should be integrated to emphasize the intimate, serene setting. | ![cs](Examples/imgs/cs.jpg) |   |  | ![cs_oc](Examples/imgs/cs_oc.jpg) |
